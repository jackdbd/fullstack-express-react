A Full-stack app built with:

- Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Redux
- Redux-Form
- Materialize CSS

# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:jackdbd/fullstack-express-react.git
cd fullstack-express-react
# install the backend
yarn install
# install the frontend
cd frontend
yarn install
```

# Usage
Thanks to [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently), you can start both the Express server and the React client.

```
cd frontend
yarn dev
```

Note: the frontend will have hot-reloading; but the backend will not.
